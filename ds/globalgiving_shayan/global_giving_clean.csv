In the process, the farmers are also being trained to become co-owners of the mill.","Pulses are grown extensively by poor farmers in pockets of southern Rajasthan. The farmers sell their produce unprocessed and normally through a chain of middlemen.

Moreover, since the farmers are scattered and not unionized, the middlemen and traders are able to dictate the prices, causing further loss to the farmers.","By cutting out middlemen and operating to ethical standards, the mill provides a fair price to farmers. It also acts as a rate equalizer, as other traders are forced to buy at a higher price, thereby benefiting those farmers not selling to the mill.  Since the mill is located in the village, it significantly cuts transport costs. Finally, farmers who are part of the cooperative are able to control the process of dal making and selling and will receive a share of any future profits.","The low incomes received from pulse cultivation have led to many farmers cultivating genetically modified cotton, which damages the soil and uses child labour.

Our country, is home to about 70% of the world's Bengal tiger population, where they unfortunately face an uncertain fate. Issues like poaching, habitat loss, human-tiger conflict, illegal trade control amongst others act as a significant threat to tigers. What can secure their future are conservation efforts that have yielded encouraging results; yet there is a need to do far more.","Today, Bengal tigers reside in only 7 per cent of their historic range of habitat - a figure that has drastically dropped by 40% in less than a decade. Encroachment of their habitat is forcing tigers into human settlements, giving rise to 'human-tiger conflict.' Moreover, local hunters and poachers trap tigers in forests, using snares which are capable of entangling big cats, causing painful death. 2014-17 has witnessed 345 tiger mortalities and 92 human casualties due to conflict and poaching.","WTI conducts training and awareness programs within local communities to empower them and devise sustainable solutions to mitigate human-wildlife conflict. We organise frequent anti-snare walks in human settlements near forest reserves.  Bandipur Tiger Reserve in southern India has alone accounted for 1161 snares! We also work in association with government bodies to protect corridors, which are direct linkages between forest patches that facilitate gene flow amongst fragmented populations.","Tigers in the wild signify a healthy forest ecosystem. Tigers also act as an umbrella species, thus ensuring sustenance of a wide range of flora and fauna. In this wild endeavour of ours, we seek your support and hope to work towards putting an end to the challenges faced by tigers. With myriad threats looming over tiger populations, the time to act is NOW! As we have embarked on a new year, buzzing with fresh opportunities, let us join hands and save Biodiversity in India.","Noida, Uttar Pradesh - India",http://www.wti.org.in,,

Children are also taught to get away from an unsafe situation and seek help from a trusted adult. The program is implemented in schools and helps children participate in their own safety and prevent instances of sexual abuse. Children can thus be saved from the trauma of sexual abuse.,"500 children will be able to identify an unsafe situation and seek help from an adult thus protect themselves from sexual abuse. 250 parents and teachers will be able to create a safety net for children and also appropriately respond and help a child when he/she discloses an instance of sexual abuse.

The project is aimed at women living in Nagercoil and neighbouring villages.,"In this extremely poor region of India, still recovering from the distruction inflicted on the area by the 2004 tsunami, women are considered far less important than men. Indeed, sometimes they are even considered a burden for families since a sizeable dowry must be offered to ensure daughters marriage. In many cases, the latter is the only acceptable social status for women, otherwise they may be ostracised from society.","The achievement of a high-school diploma enables young women to start their own business or find employment as office workers (schools, hospitals, state offices etc.).  This means they can support themselves and the whole family. In some cases, at the end of a course in dressmaking, the graduates are given a sewing machine so they can immediately start a small business in their home village.","The main goal is to promote active participation for women by giving them employment as a mean of empowerment, encouraging co-operation as a form of social enterprise.

Today, these women face hurdles in their daily lives as their inability to read and write constrain them in adding value in important life events like school admission of their children and parent-teacher meets. They also face hurdles in earning a decent livelihood for their own survival. Illiteracy makes them vulnerable to socio-economic exploitation.",We aim to impart functional literacy to adult illiterate women in the age group of 16-45 years. The objective is to give an opportunity to these women to learn how to read and write in their regional languages and to carry out daily monetary and bank transactions. They will also be made aware of their socio-political surroundings and the stakeholders who can help them to connect to various government welfare schemes. The project entails a 3 month's literacy program using innovative techniques.,"The project will provide the ability to read, write, do basic arithmetic and impart knowledge about government schemes to 1000 women, in 30 batches of 30-35 each.

Vulnerable girls from poor socio-economic backgrounds are often sold, kidnapped or lured into forced prostitution under false promises of marriage and well paid jobs.

Intensifying this problem is the clandestine nature of the industry coupled with the evolving methods of traffickers and brothel owners.","This project seeks to rescue, rehabilitate and provide access to justice for girls, particularly minors, who are victims of trafficking and forced prostitution in South India.

We also offer legal aid to the rescued girls to advocate for their best interests.","Free a Girl works with our local partners to rescue girls and provide freedom and direct relief. In the long term, it is through the continuous rescue raids and prosecution of perpetrators that trafficking networks are dismantled, brothel owners are deterred from exploiting girls, and local law enforcement are increasingly sensitized about this crime.

Simultaneously, there are limited resources for guarding protected areas in the countries where tigers live.  The result is a never-ending battle against poaching, which is now often orchestrated by transnational crime syndicates that profit from wildlife crime.","Project C.A.T., a Discovery/WWF partnership, provides funding to support protected areas of habitat critical to tiger survival, monitor tiger populations through camera traps, and build effective ranger programs to combat poaching.

When these children go to middle school and beyond, they are unable to cope up and eventually drop out by high school.","A comprehensive package is provided for strengthening primary and upper primary rural class-rooms by providing: a para teacher to provide individual attention to children; classroom infrastructural needs, like electrification, fans, lights; note books and educational aides; computer education; nutritional supplementation;  transportation access to school; and most of all addressing children's learning challenges early on, so they are able to achieve class and age appropriate learning milestone.","The project will strengthen rural children early on in primary and upper primary school, so that they are able to learn and achieve school success.  This will lead to reduced school drop outs in rural areas, and ensure that 100% of students complete high school successfully.  Over time this will elevate the educational status of every village which is sure to transform these communities level of empowerment and ability to make informed decisions towards their own development.","Chennai, Tamil Nadu - India",http://www.kalanjiyam.org/,,

Work in India has recorded declines in excess of 95% in populations of three species across 12 Indian states since the early 1990s. In central Gujarat we aim to save oriental white-rumped vultures and other migratory vultures. We will focus on saving vultures and their natural habitat through regular monitoring of nesting/roosting, and feeding sites, multi-stakeholder participation at grass roots through awareness and advocacy.","The non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) diclofenac, used to treat domestic livestock, has been identified as the major cause of mortality in South Asia.  Vultures are unable to process diclofenac and other vulture-toxic NSAIDs which then cause renal failure resulting in deaths. One of the main challenges now is preventing human Diclofenac and other NSAIDs from being used for veterinary purposes. Vultures deaths also occur due to kite-string injury, dehydration and poisoning.","We will create Vulture Safe Habitats through intensive monitoring, awareness, and advocacy at grass root level with benefits to local community. Incidental poisoning will be reduced due to farmer engagement. Vulture rescues will be more efficient due to regular field work. Each individual vulture is important and saving each is critical for species conservation.","Safe, NSAID and vulture-toxin free environment will be created for potential reintroduction of captive bred, and remaining wild vultures. With increased wild population, there will be direct ecological benefits including carcass disposal of wild and domestic ungulates, indirect control of street dog population and related zoonotic diseases.

This programme lends farmers money to buy a new drip irrigation system and teaches them how to use it. Higher crop yields result in higher incomes. Over five years, farmers pay back the money they were lent and the funds are then lent to a new farmer to buy a drip irrigation system. The programme offers a lot of hands on support. Drip irrigation is a simple system but hugely effective.","In Rajasthan, farmers currently use flood irrigation to grow crops. This is an inefficient use of water - leading to significantly lower crop yields. Furthermore, by watering the whole field, farmers need to spend a lot of time weeding. This work is typically left to women and girls.  If there is not a sufficient income from farming,  men are forced to move to the cities looking for work, leaving behind their families. Breaking up the family unit in this way is hugely detrimental to communities.","Drip irrigation involves a rubber tube running along the line of crops. At the base of each crop, a small hole is made in the rubber tube. This hole lets out just a few drops of water (depending on the crop). This ensures just enough water is needed and none is wasted. The soil between the crops is not watered so weeds struggle to survive. Not only does this significantly reduce the amount of water needed but it also reduces the amount of time a farmer needs to spend tending to the crops.","Loaning farmers funds to invest in a drip irrigation system will lift them out of poverty. As each farmer is lifted out of poverty, their children, especially girls, will be free to go to school - vital in transforming any community. As farmers incomes go up, they can repay their loans and neighbouring farmers will be able to take out a loan to invest in their own drip irrigation system living them out of poverty.

But for almost 80 million girls, this is where it begins. Girls in India live with restrictions: from being taught early that they will always be second best, to being married off at a young age. Rarely do girls get a say in their own lives. Yet they dream. And you can help girls realise that their dreams aren't impossible to fulfill.","On reaching adolescence, girls are often married to men much older than them, well before they're of legal age. Once married, they fail to deal with the power dynamics in their new homes and are likely to face domestic violence or sexual abuse. These child brides go on to become mothers when they should still be going to school; thus the cycle continues. The reason: A mindset in which girls are not valued, rendering them powerless to make any decisions about their own lives.","The solution is simple: girls need to be valued as individuals and as members of the community, so that they can have control over their lives and bodies. This is where you come in. When you donate to Breakthrough, you help us support girls like Rashmi. You ensure that they continue their education and are equipped to stand up for themselves. They can become leaders and pave the way for other girls around them. They can do this, because of you.","It starts with one dream, but it doesn't end there.

Thus, it is a problem that cannot be ignored. About 85% of the offenders are known to the victim & only 25% of the victims speak about their plight. Since it is not possible to keep an eye on the children all the time, creating awareness on the issue is the need of the hour. This project aims to fulfill this by undertaking awareness meetings/gatherings with community members, youth and school children in its rural and urban work areas.","During our periodic interactions with community women, they voiced their concerns with regard to safety & security of their children while they were out at work. Women further added that they often have to choose between safety of their children and earning their wages. Parents of sexually abused children are scared to tell anyone due to fear of being shamed in society. The trauma of sexual abuse in children often impacts the children through life; they become guilty, fearful, lonely & worried.","Laws alone are not enough to curb child sexual abuse. The solution lies in creating widespread awareness of the issue by educating community members, youth, teachers & school children. The process in which the children are groomed, lured & victimized is conveyed through audio-visual and visual aids. Children are enlightened about safe & unsafe touch and to get away from an unsafe situation & seek help from a trusted adult. The project thus helps children to be saved from this brutality & trauma.","We have already launched the project by orienting over 100 teachers & youth from the work area. Over the year, 2000 participants covering school children, teachers & youth will be better informed about identifying & preventing child abuse. Parents & teachers will be competent to appropriately respond & help a child when she/he discloses an instance of sexual abuse. The children exposed to awareness through this project will grow into healthy adults without any ill effect of sexual abuse.",Ahmedabad - India,http://www.awagindia.org,https://www.facebook.com/awagindia,

They are invited to attend computer and English classes as well as all kinds of extracurricular workshops that Sakhi Trust facilitates.","The fee support project grants higher education for girls and boys who want to pursue an academic career but whose situation doesn't allow them to.
