Under education, Sarthak Prayas runs remedial education centers where students from government schools attend classes every day to improve their knowledge. The centres help students complete their homework and revise lessons of the day. They also impart life skills and teach them how to deal with real life situations.

Each day the students attend sessions for approximately 90 minutes. Their other program focuses on people at the other end of the age spectrum, the underprivileged elderly. The premise behind this is that the elderly have struggled all their life for food, shelter and livelihood.

126,Salaam Baalak Trust - Delhi,children,Delhi,"SBT aims to provide a sensitive and caring environment to the street and working children and other children on the margins of society. It seeks to dissolve the barriers that rob these children of the opportunity to realize their rights.In the 1980s, the making of Mira Nair’s ‘Salaam Bombay’ (award winning film) revealed the dark underbelly of Mumbai’s streets, where several childhoods were at stake. A combination of socio-economic exigencies, political circumstances and parents’ struggle for survival created a large population of children, living and working on the streets of India. All across the country, the street children, an invisible section of the society, continued an invisible struggle on the streets of Delhi too.In the day time, children grapple with the challenges of street life. When night falls, they curl up in crevices - at the end of the platform, under a staircase, in the subway - where the possibility of security exists. Ms Praveen Nair, Chairperson and Trustee at Salaam Baalak Trust testifies: “It took us quite a while to break the ice with the boys. Sanjoy (Roy) and myself would scout the railway platforms every day, chat with the boys, however they had been cheated time and again, and we weren’t the first to propose help. So, they would laugh off our intentions but we never gave up. Finally, when we answered their urgent call for help to care for a terribly sick boy, a friend of theirs, began the never-ending bond.”Having spent quality time with these children, the founding members of the Trust realised that while most of these children were forced into these circumstances, many of them had chosen this life. What set them apart, was their chutzpah, their spirit. Ms Nair adds: “We started with the idea of donating blankets to the children in the bitter winter cold. We started at the very place where GRP centre now stands. However, we were naive about their actual needs. The children told us that sleeping under a blanket invited sexual attentions from older children. They stuffed newspapers and wore layers of clothing (all the clothes they possessed, actually) which not only kept them warm but also kept the clothes from being stolen! That’s when we realised that these children needed a roof over their heads and safe spaces.”From three staff and 25 children on a balcony of the Ground Reserve Police at the New Delhi Railway station more than 32 years ago, we have now grown to over 250 staff, providing support services for approximately 10000 children a year in Delhi and the NCR region through our 7 shelter homes and 10 contact points.Over the years, Salaam Baalak Trust has successfully worked with over 1 lakh children; out of which significant numbers have been restored to their families. Every year almost 10-11 children across SBT pursue higher education. We have children who grew up to become lawyers, fashion designers, photographers, puppeteers and engineers. This year, three of our children have got more than 80 percent in their 12th board exams.Sponsor runaway children to reunite with their families2nd Floor, DDA Community Centre, Paharganj New Delhi 110055",+91 11 23586416," 2nd Floor, DDA Community Centre, Chandiwali Gali, Paharganj New Delhi 110055",contact@salaambaalaktrust.org,https://www.giveindia.org/nonprofit/salaam-baalak-trust-delhi

133,"Sathi, Bangalore",children,Karnataka,"In 1992, an organization called Prerana had been working with farmers in North Karnataka's Raichur district. Prerana offered its office as a shelter for children, who were mostly living on Raichur railway station.Over the next 3 to 4 years, the activities with the children expanded and recreational activities were included such as picnics, skill training programs like cycle-repair, screen printing and so on. Although the attempts to place them in jobs met limited success, the engagement with children continued. After a family adopted one child, they realized that many of these children were not abandoned by their families, but had opted to 'flee' because of certain reasons (which in most cases were not very serious) without actually thinking of the consequences.The concept of 'restoration' or 'home-placement' of children thus began to take shape. Ground research revealed that the parents are also distraught when the child leaves; and they often attempt to search the child without any leads. There was a zeal within the team members to work on this issue in a dedicated manner and a new organization was carved out of Prerana. SATHI was born.Founded in 1992, SATHI was formally registered in 1997 in Raichur, Karnataka. With the growth of the organization and expansion of work, SATHI moved its head office to Bangalore. Over the years, SATHI has worked in more than 40 different locations in 14 states across India and has helped nearly 60,000 children reunite with their families.Passionate about children and their well-being, Pramod Kulkarni founded SATHI with an initial focus on providing immediate care and opportunities of resettlement for run-away children. Experience and research convinced him that run-away children could be settled back with families. An action-oriented individual, he decided to demonstrate this possibility - in large numbers and at a national scale.SATHI continued to work with Raichur as a base until the year 2000. During this phase, the work was restricted to Raichur and Wadi in Karnataka and Guntakal in Andhra Pradesh. From 2000 to 2006, the work expanded to cover other locations in Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh and Maharashtra. The year 2000 also marked the beginning of SATHI's work in Government Children Homes.The year 2006 marked a new phase in SATHI's history, when it began to expand its geographical spread across the country through collaborations with other NGOs.

142,TANKER Foundation,health,Tamil Nadu,"Founded in 1993, The Tamilnad Kidney Research Foundation was set up primarily to provide financial assistance to underprivileged patients for dialysis, transplantation, investigation and medication costs. The Foundation also aims to encourage organ donation at the time of death. TANKER was started by Dr. Georgi Abraham along with a group of like-minded individuals. From providing financial assistance to needy patients and spreading awareness to providing subsidized and free dialysis, TANKER has taken every effort to live up to its vision. It currently provides services in the following areas:Dialysis: A person suffering from kidney failure can survive only when he/she undergoes dialysis or a kidney transplantation. Haemodialysis involves the use of an artificial kidney termed ""Dialyser"", which emulates the functions of a normal kidney. It needs to be done 2-3 times a week and is an expensive process. TANKER Foundation has made dialysis affordable for economically backward sections using their Subsidised Units. Dialysis in a private hospital costs anywhere between Rs 1500 to Rs. 2500. At TANKER, dialysis is offered either free or at a subsidised rate of Rs. 375 to patients. It costs TANKER Rs.1100 for every dialysis. The shortfall of Rs.725 is covered by donations from well wishers. Presently 377 patients benefit from this every month.Fistula- An A V fistula is essential for dialysis. This is created surgically by joining a vein to an artery in the area of the wrist. Impure blood is first drawn from the fistula on the patient's wrist, passed through the dialyser machine and clean blood is returned to the patient. A Fistula surgery costs between Rs. 10,000/- to Rs. 15,000/-, which is beyond what many patients can afford. Financial Support- The Foundation helps needy patients from all over India by offering them one-time contributions ranging from Rs.1,500/- to Rs.20,000/- towards transplantation, investigation and post-transplantation medication costs. Research grants- The importance of advances in Kidney research is recognised by TANKER. Funding is provided to research projects for studies in various aspects of kidney disease. Internships and training- TANKER at its various dialysis units provides training and internship for budding nurses, lab technicians and those looking at Administrative roles. The Foundation is also a training ground for students of Social Work, Public Relations and Sociology.Organ Donation- TANKER encourages deceased-donor organ donation that can be a boon for not just kidney patients but also for others suffering from life threatening ailments. Deceased-donor organ donation is not very popular in our country and hence the recipient waiting lists are long.Deceased-donor organ donation consists of removing viable organs from brain dead donors and then transplanting them into a living patient who needs it. Soon after a patient is declared brain dead (the patient is dead but the heart maintains circulation usually with mechanical ventilation support), the organs are harvested. The harvested organs are then kept cold to delay the natural decaying process. These are then transplanted to the needy patient.TANKER under the Deceased-Donor Transplantation Programme, sponsored a meeting of surgeons and physicians in October, 2005. Their recommendation to the health Secretary resulted in the expansion of the panel of specialists who certify brain-stem death. The TANKER Trustee Doctors were part of the team that performed the first government approved multi organ deceased-donor transplant in December 1995. TANKER also supports MOHAN (Multi Organ Harvesting Aid Network) Foundation in creating awareness about deceased-donor organ donation.Provide anti rejection medicines post kidney transplantSponsor fistula surgery of a poor patient",+914443090998,"Flat.

This phenomenon is common to all Dalit women. This kind of injustice unveiled by the society on the women folk hurt her feelings from childhood. This inner urge and burning desire motivated her to start an organisation for the cause of women, especially Dalit.The founder's father was a school head master and she always had an inclination towards social service looking at the condition of the people living in remote areas of her village, especially women. Thereafter, she decided to start SHGs and also had offers to join the govt. but decided not to do so as that would mean having to succumb to political pressure. Slowly, the activities gained momentum and she increased the focus areas. She has received a lot of support from her husband. The organization is run by women and works for women beneficiaries from the dalit community (especially scavengers) irrespective of religion.Mrs. Nancy has 16 years of experience in organizing the unorganized labours like bullock cart workers, farmers, domestic workers, scavengers and rural artisans and development works. She has organized 680 women self help groups. She is a master trainer in Entrepreneur development training and self help group members and leaders.Vizhuthukal Trust primarily works for landless labourers, agricultural coolies and scavengers in Tirunelveli. Due to modernization and urbanization, agricultural activity has come down narrowly over the years. So women in the village find it very difficult to find any kind of work. The condition of destitute, abandoned and widowed women gets further worsened against this background. Vizhuthukal Trust runs various development programs for the welfare of the rural community under Tirunelveli Corporation. One of these is their educational program, through which they support play centres. In a survey that the Trust conducted amongst these children, they learnt that many children had expressed that their wish is to celebrate their birthdays with their friends and family. So the organisation has a program for celebrating birthdays of children.The organization's primary focus is to work for the betterment of children, women and the aged (primarily women).

160,Antarang Foundation,education,Maharashtra,"Antarang envisions a world where every young person is productively, positively and passionately engaged in a vocation of their choice.Priya Agrawal and Lopa Gandhi have worked extensively with adolescents from low income settlements. The gap between education and employment was a big one to bridge - and without employment education seemed meaningless and added to the frustration of youth from these disadvantaged communities. Youth tended to drop out and meander aimlessly at the vulnerable 16 - 18 year age group. Thus was born an intervention that looked at specific career outcomes that gave purpose and direction to their lives. Antarang started with a pilot group of 20 youth from slums across Mumbai in a 6 weekend intervention. The success of that pilot and the resultant placement of >50% of youth from that group slowly led to more groups and more partnerships.Priya Agrawal has held key leadership roles in the social sector, having headed organisations like The Akanksha Foundation and SNEHA in the past.Antarang Foundation is a registered not-for-profit organisation that works with disadvantaged young adults. Through structured interventions, they motivate young people to stay in education until they are 18, after which, they train them in employability skills and place them in careers of their choice. They do this through two career focused programmes CareerAware and CareeReady.Their CareeReady programme is a career readiness and employability skills training programme for youth in the age group of 18 - 25 years. Students undergo a well-defined regiment of development and training. The program consists of 5 key aspects spread over different sessions: Career awareness, Self-awareness, Work skills, Work ethics and Business spoken English.CareeReady groups in the communities are a mix of adolescents with different educational backgrounds - some may be school dropouts, others may be pursuing their 12th or beyond. Different techniques are used to keep the batch engaged given the inconsistent educational backgrounds. Several batches of CareerReady Programme are run simultaneously across multiple locations in Mumbai. Keeping this diversity in mind, facilitators or trainers use a 'Buddy System' which enhances learning as well as boosts confidence.Rather than a one-way dialogue, all concepts are explained with the help of role plays and various activities. Students are also encouraged to work on projects in groups. They support interactive style of learning rather than a lecture/authority style of delivery. They believe in the concept of 'Do and Learn' and therefore, promote self-learning to develop critical thinking skills and retain knowledge that leads to self-actualisation. Trainers also use audio-visual aids as and when required to introduce an element of fun!The CareerAware program""What do you want to be when you grow up?"" is at once an exciting and terrifying question for any teenager or young adult. At this stage, it is the awareness of options, the ability to make an informed choice and the process of charting out a career path that motivates adolescents and young adults to stick to education, and set career goals. In India, the Right to education ends at the age of 14, and only 1 in 2 children complete high school. The ratio of students in higher education is sadly even lower. Every school drop-out is prone to high risk behaviour, and usually end up in informal employment, characterised by low wages and no benefits.To break this cycle, Antarang introduced the CareerAware program. The program targets students who fall in the crucial 14 - 17 years age bracket. Through intensive self awareness, career awareness and career planning sessions, CareerAware encourages teenagers to stay in education until they are 18 years old. By emphasising on the number and quality of options that become available only if they stay in education, CareerAware reinforces the importance of education in young minds.",+ 022 4005 0164,"231/C, Tawripada Compound, Dr SS Rao Road, Lalbaug, Parel, Mumbai 400012 Maharashtra",info@antarangfoundation.org,https://www.giveindia.org/nonprofit/antarang-foundation

Patients were mainly referred by Spastic Society. Until 1997-98 the boys were sent to Spastic Society for vocational training. However slowly Kutumba started accepting girls but as there was an issue housing boys and girls, they started weaning of the boys. Once the last boy had left they tied up with APD to offer safe housing for the girls attending APD vocational training courses.Kutumba was operating out of rented premises until 2006 they moved into their own premises.
