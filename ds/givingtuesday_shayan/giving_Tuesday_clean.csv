Our vision is an India where all children are treated equally, are provided a nurturing support system and have access to an education that gives them the confidence and skills to follow their dreams. Our mission is to level the playing field for children who have neither seen books nor stepped into a school. The children we work with come from extremely impoverished backgrounds and are mostly rag pickers, beggars, addicts, runaways and orphans. We currently work with over a 3,351 children.
Aasraa Trust seeks to alleviate poverty in Dehradun by providing the many disenfranchised children in the city with the opportunity to pursue an education. Our organization has crafted a cyclical approach. Our projects include outreach to bring children into basic literacy, street smart to prepare for schooling, sponsorship for education, after school tutorial support, mobile learning centers, anti- begging and vocational training, nutrition, medical, clothing and shelter.
Firstly, we start by reaching out to children in the slums through our outreach team. Then the children are initiated into the first step of our Street Smart education project where we conduct classes within the neighborhood to foster trust and basic education, committed students move to the next step of the program at a facility that provides a more structured classroom environment where the children learn basic Hindi, English, and Mathematics.
Once they have achieved an elementary level education, we help to mainstream these children into formal schools by providing scholarships that pay their school fees and living expenses.
Children who have entered the formal schooling, then become a part of our other project, ‚Wings of Doon‚ which is an after-school program that promotes character building and academic achievement. The children who attend this program also take advantage of tutorials in a wide range of subjects. These complementary projects work to provide children access to schooling and the tools and support to help them thrive academically.
We launched an Anti-Begging Campaign for child beggars in January 2014 in association with the Dehradun District Administration. The goal of the campaign is to discourage child beggary, provide the child beggars with basic literacy, lessons in hygiene, grooming, art therapy, nutrition and medical care. As a part of this project, young adults are provided with vocational training in sewing and block printing as well.
Children who for various reasons are unable to gain entrance into mainstream schools are provided the option of NIOS. We are a study and exam center from the National Institute of Open Schooling for its ‚Open Basic Education Program. We also provide vocational training for young adults to enable them to earn a respectable livelihood in the future.
Working children who do not attend school due to their socio-economic condition are provided basic literacy through our Mobile Learning Centers that are classrooms on wheels teaching through high tech e-learning methods. This is a fun interactive way of learning that keeps the children's interest alive and helps in regularizing them in the classroom setup.
For boys and girls who come from a home environment that is not conducive to their educational pursuit, Aasraa also provides shelter homes.
In addition to this we provide nutritional support and a medical aid that covers children throughout all our projects.",518,FY 2019-20,"In the last 10 years, we have grown from 35 children under the Bindal Bridge to over a 3,351 children across 39 centres in Dehradun.
 649 children have been initiated into basic literacy through the Street Smart program.
The after school support program i.e. Wings of Doon, assists 1,895 children, which include mainstreamed Aasraa
children and students from various Government Schools.
In January 2019, we signed another MOU with the Uttarakhand Education Department for School Quality Enhancement Program (SQEP) allowing us to work with and improve the quality of education in 6 Government Schools in Dehradun. 1021 children have been mainstreamed into local schools; government and private.
Aasraa is accredited by The National Institute of Open Schooling (NIOS) as a study and exam
centre. We are also an accredited Vocational Training Centre by the NIOS; 2 Vocational Training Centres established; 70 youth benefit from these projects.

Aastha Foundation Aurangabad is registered under Bombay public Trust Act and Societies Act and is established in 2008 by a group of young, dynamic, socially aware people with a dream of making positive changes in various areas of our Society.
A detailed study in this area revealed that, there is a need of a centre which will provide a much needed attention, Comfort and care, love, dignity and respect to the Senior Citizens. In today‚Äôs fast paced life where everybody is focused on wining the rat race, we usually tend to over-look our final destination. What really matters is how we spend this golden years of our lives when all our hardship and effort pay off. This is the time when one really looks forward for a life of dignity, safety and care, but life doesn‚Äôt always seem to work on our plans. There are cases where one has a very few options to choose from. There people who have no company of the loved ones who took great care of them all their lives. Some people have only daughters who are now married happily and would not want to disturb them. Some might have sons who are settled in abroad or sometimes there are some personal family issues which don‚Äôt allow them to stay with their family.
And thus, emerged the idea of ‚ÄòBasant Prabha-Visawa‚Äô and it proposes to establish a residential housing and assisted living for the Senior Citizens. This will be constructed as ‚Äò Basant Prabha-Visawa‚Äô on a 3-acre land and will provide twin sharing room with sanitation facilities along with lawn and garden, dining hall and kitchen, meditation room and physiotherapy, counseling and cultural events.
‚ÄòAastha‚Äô believes that ‚ÄòAgeing with Dignity‚Äô is possible. It has organized various programs to address the needs of Senior Citizens, such as health entertainment & making them more and more independent. The programs include Acupressure camp, Walkathon, Eye checkup camps, Bone density checking camp, Stress reliving workshop, Alzheimer awareness.

In his such an eclipsed & helpless condition, mental anguish & bitter experience when he did not find any way out to help and stand by them and was groping about in the dark – the almighty God taught him many lessons about these helpless lives and devastated society and He by His words and speeches penetrated into his heart and life ‘Caring for orphans, widows and who need help, and keeping yourself free from the world’s evil influence’ (James-1: 27). Upon solemn and sturdy foundation of these instructions, ASS gets established in the month of April, 1995 with manifold oppositions, hurdles and risks.

ARAMBHA Foundation is a registered Trust, established in 2014 in Koparkhairane Navi Mumbai, initiated in 2014 under the leadership of its founder Mrs. Rakhi Pandit, who along with her experienced and committed team, perpetuated a new lease of life for children with physically able and mentally challenged children in the poor and middle class community. Hence the name ARAMBHA a Sanskrit word pronounced as Arambh meaning ‘Beginning’ or ‘Commencement’ of a New Life for the PAMC.(Physically Able And Mentally Challenged Children).
Mrs. Rakhi Pandit is herself a professional special educator with 10+ years of experience having worked with reputed institutions. After her own observation and research in this domain in her locality and community, she discovered that there was an urgent need of an organization that would serve in compassion and with empathy, offering quality and cost effective services with an all round growth and development of the children through rehabilitation and education. This gave birth to her inventiveness and start-up of Arambha Foundation especially for the poor, underprivileged, marginalized and economically backward section of the society.
The Trust was initiated with a meek and respectful beginning & commenced its work with a compact group of 7 children after its Govt. registration in the year 2015 (Arambha Foundation is registered under Maharashtra Public Trust Act 1950, in the year 2015.

The approach is found to be more cost-effective and uptake of new practices by viewers is higher compared to traditional extension services.

Each week, smallholder farmers in India spend as much as a full day selling their produce at the nearest market, incurring especially high opportunity and transport costs when their production volumes are low. To reduce those costs, Digital Green created Loop, a mobile app that enables farmers to more efficiently access markets by helping them aggregate their perishable produce.
In an effort to address the holistic needs of rural communities, we focus on maternal, newborn and child health as well as hygiene and sanitation practices.

A few like-minded students joined them giving strength to their campaigns. ‚ÄúThe Earth provides enough to satisfy every man‚Äôs need, but not every man‚Äôs greed.‚Äù ‚Äì Gandhiji

IDF's journey began in 2004 when a group of people from varying backgrounds decided to make a difference in the lives of those less privileged than them. After IDF was established as an NGO on January 24th 2005, it has relentlessly worked in the spheres of education, health, empowerment of women and awareness of underprivileged communities.
IDF strongly believes in the power of education as a tool of empowerment and as a way to break taboos and stereotypes. This belief shapes all our programs and the work we do. Our flagship programs involve working with children in underprivileged communities to impact formal, informal and vocational education. These programs are supplemented by counselling sessions for families to highlight the importance of educating their children.
IDF has a proven track record in the conceptualisation of long-lasting community strategies and strengthening of existing facilities that help those who need it the most. The IDF also reinforces quality reforms that not only enthuse and inspire but also sensitise society to pressing issues facing young women and girls.
A special focus remains on females and ensuring that they are enrolled in formal education, included in the society and not adversely impacted by gender discrimination.
IDF works by being involved in grass-root level change by counselling reluctant and financially constrained parents and their children to turn to education.
Since 2013, IDF has been recognised as an organisation in Special Consultative Status with the Economic and Social Council of the United Nations. IDF is also certified with GuideStar India, GiveIndia, the Credibility Alliance for good voluntary organisation governance and with Charities Aid Foundation India for complying with due diligence requirements.
VISION
""A healthy, educated and developed society"".
MISSION
Our mission is to work towards achieving, at the grassroots level, eradication of illiteracy and gender discrimination in underprivileged communities by educating them and creating awareness.",,,"Giving Wings to Children‚Äôs Dreams:
The Indian Dreams Foundation (IDF) aims to improve literacy, eradicate gender discrimination and accelerate life chances for children from underprivileged communities. IDF works to create positive and long-lasting change in disadvantaged communities around the city of Agra by:
ÔÉº increasing access to schooling and vocational education
ÔÉº inspiring communities to value education for all their children, girls as well as boys
ÔÉº mobilising the community to take action and ownership of their development
ÔÉº improving the quality of education in government primary and upper primary schools
Leaving No One Behind:
IDF takes a holistic approach and believes that education means more than just academic excellence; it should incorporate the development of soft skills, a value system and civic-mindedness. Its five flagship programmes are:
1. Honhar Ladki (A Promising Girl):
An education sponsorship and mentoring program support adolescent girls from rural and urban slums. The program has been ongoing for eight years and carefully sorts beneficiaries from disadvantaged communities using a three-tier selection process. As well as enrolling girls into formal schools and paying for their educational expenses, crucially the programme takes a multi-faceted approach to ensure parental commitment and reduce drop-out rates by:
ÔÇ? developing half-yearly progress reports for each beneficiary
ÔÇ? arranging periodic parent-teacher meetings so that parents better understand their child‚Äôs achievements
ÔÇ? organising monthly sessions where IDF staff talk with teachers
about attendance and performance
ÔÇ? providing mentors for the girls to help them achieve independence and develop self-confidence
ÔÇ? celebrating quarterly Wellness Days to educate pupils on health and hygiene, menstruation and nutrition
Direct impact: 
# 700 girls have been part of the Honhar Ladki program to date. 
Indirect Impact:
# Approximately 1000 additional girls have benefitted indirectly.
2. Adopt-a-School Program:
At IDF, we want schools to be a springboard to enable children to make their dreams come true and transform both their lives and their families. However, government schools, particularly in rural areas, suffer from a lack of funds, quantity and quality of teachers, and inadequate water and sanitation facilities.
Since 2008, IDF has been adopting government schools and improving their infrastructure, academic performance and learning environment in line with the UN‚Äôs Sustainable Development Goals.
IDF collaborates with government authorities to:
ÔÇ? build separate toilet facilities for girls and boys
ÔÇ? provide books and teaching resources and conduct teacher training
ÔÇ? Introduce mid-day meals for students
Direct Impact:
# IDF has adopted 6 government schools in the Agra area, and more than 2,000 children have benefitted to date.
Indirect Impact: 
# Approximately 5,000 people living in surrounding communities have been impacted.
3. Ready 2 School:
This is a non-formal educational initiative started by IDF targeting those children who have dropped out of school or girls from minority communities. Through the programme, IDF aims to build the children‚Äôs confidence, social skills and their academic ability so that they may ultimately enrol in formal education.
The emphasis is on making study easy, fun and exciting but at the same time, the performance of each child is monitored using specialist tools developed by experienced educational professionals. 
The Centre‚Äôs extra-curricular activities include:
ÔÇ? regular community sessions to transform local attitudes to girl‚Äôs education
ÔÇ? monthly parent-teacher meetings to discuss each child‚Äôs development
ÔÇ? Saturday is celebrated as a Fun Days where children learn arts and crafts, singing, dance, storytelling etc.
ÔÇ? quarterly Wellness Days where children can get eye & teeth check-ups and access to vaccine programmes
Direct Impact:
# More than 500 girls and boys have attended the Dreams Learning Centre to date.
Indirect Impact: 
# Approximately 2,000 slum dwellers are aware of the importance of education.
5. Smiley Days:(every girl has the right to smile and lead a healthy life)
Smiley Days is a new initiative that raises awareness of female health issues in economically challenged communities and promotes good personal hygiene practices for girls aged 11-20 years. Myths and taboos have always surrounded menstruation in many Indian societies, and a lack of knowledge and understanding has led to girls missing school or dropping out of education altogether.
An IDF survey found that 60% of females use old fabrics to manage their menstruation, 22% do not have a private toilet at home, and 46% do not go to school during their menses. Key Smiley Days activities include:
ÔÇ? Community outreach - workshops, counselling sessions and campaigns for example
ÔÇ? Resource provision ‚Äìhealth check-ups, sanitary napkins, hygiene kits etc.
ÔÇ? Awareness towards MHM, Puberty, SRHR and WASH practices among adolescent girls and young women",,http://www.idf4all.org,info@idf4all.org,91-7060050184,"Shop-14, Block-11, Kapda Market,

We share a common dream ‚Äì a world where every child is showered with love and is given opportunities for their bright future; a world where no child‚Äôs innocence is marred by the horrors of child labour, and a world where women‚Äôs wellbeing is paid attention to and they‚Äôre empowered to sustain themselves and their family.
Despite being the capital of India, Delhi has over 4 million people living in makeshift homes in slums that are overcrowded, lack adequate water supply, sanitation, and security. Children of these slum dwellers often do not get access to basic education and instead have to start working to support their family. At such a tender age, they are forced to grow up in a haste and suffer the loss of their childhood and innocence. They are taken advantage of by employers who use them as cheap labour. United Nations recognises the deprivation of these resources to be a violation of fundamental human rights. It is not just the responsibility of the government to promote and protect human rights and fundamental freedoms of individuals or groups. It is the duty of us ‚Äì the citizens ‚Äì to do our bit in ensuring equal advancement of all sections of the society.
The statistics and the problem is same across India when we talk about less privileged one in our country be it rural or urban India.
We at Lakshyam vowed to put an end to this widespread violation of people‚Äôs fundamental rights, especially of women and children residing in the slums of metropolitan cities. We aim to empower them through education and employment by implementing models of development that are tailored to the needs of the community. Lakshyam has organised programmes such as ‚Äì Butterfly- Child Welfare and Education (wherein basic education is provided to impoverished children through comprehensive learning methods), Lakshyam Toy Library (wherein the child‚Äôs growth is supplemented using educational toys, games and books in an environment which cultivates and encourages the child‚Äôs imagination and creativity), Rooh ‚Äì Awakening Women‚Äôs soul (wherein women are empowered to generate self-employment and a means of income using training of vocational and professional skills), and Project Aarogya (providing accessible and affordable healthcare to the underprivileged).",,,,,http://lakshyam.co.in,activity@lakshyam.co.in,91-9540790002,"B1/27A,Ground floor, Hauz khas,New Delhi-110016,

Mahamanav Baba Amte Bahuddashiya Samajik Vikas Sewa Sanstha is a unique NGO established in Taluka Shrigonda of Ahmednagar district (Maharashtra state). We have come a long way since 2008 when we started education programmes for children of neglected and deprived sections of the society.   We believe in the philosophy that ‘Every child should have the right to a life free from inequality, cruelty and discrimination’.
Our programmes are primarily for children affected by poverty including the tribal communities of Phasay Pardhi and Dombari.  We help to provide education for underprivileged children. We cater for more than 500 beneficiaries.
INITIATIVES
Presently, we have 6 projects all over Taluka Shrigonda dedicated to our mission. Our initiatives are focussed on core dimensions of education and awareness that directly address specific needs of our beneficiaries on their journey to self-empowerment.
A.	Education
Students Aid Committee (Vidyarthi Sahayyak Samiti), Sadhana Bal Bhavan, Aarambh Bal Vidya Niketan, Freedom Fighter Ramanlal Mehta Library and Bharat Ratna Dr. A.P.J Abdul Kalaam Study Center.
?	Students Aid Committee (Vidyarthi Sahayyak Samiti)
The Phase Paradhi community is an ancient tribe of India. They used to live in remote and inaccessible jungles and were very primitive in their lifestyle. They used to hunt in the jungles for their food. But when the British rulers implemented a ban on hunting in the jungles, this tribe was unable to integrate with the rural population. As a result they resorted to criminal activities to feed their families. For generations, they have been involved in criminal activities and never went to any school. At times, they are unfairly blamed for crimes they have not committed.  Mahamanav Baba Amte Sewa Sanstha has taken up the noble cause of uplifting this community. We have taken the responsibility of educating the children and stop the vicious circle of crime and give them a chance in their life. We provide hostel facility, admission to local school, regular and nutritious meals, tuitions and most importantly inculcate values in the children. Along with academics, we teach the children to share and care for each other. We install discipline and the importance of honesty and hard work. It is a fact - if  Mahamanav Baba Amte Sewa Sanstha's intervention hadn't been, these children too would have been labeled as criminals. We are proud to say that Mahamanav Baba Amte Sewa is guiding the children of the Phasay Pardhi community towards a bright future by educating them and at the same time reducing the crime rate of our country.
?	Sadhana Bal Bhavan 
Taluka Shrigonda is a city and Sasane Nagar a slum which houses over 1,500 residents a part of Shrigonda.The women of these slums engage in occupations such as labourers on farm or domestic work. They are illiterate labourers and are unable to guide their children with their studies. Mahamanav Baba Amte Bahuddashiya Samajik Vikas Sewa Sanstha started the Sadhana Bal Bhavan project to help the children of these slums with their studies and to mould these children into respectable citizens. Free tuitions are given to these children and workshops on health and hygiene, de-addiction, communal unity, prevention of underage marriages, dowry, etc are conducted by various experts to bring about a positive change in the society. Thus Sadhana Bal Bhavan is a movement towards profoundness and nation building. Currently 80 kids are marching towards a bright future at Sadhana Bal Bhavan.
?	Aarambh Bal Vidya Niketan
This is a unique project where youth of a village named Kashti are engrossed in nation building by educating the children of the poor, neglected sections and the Dombari community while building their own future at the same time. They are doing this out of a sense of patriotism and the urge to share their knowledge with the needy, poor and deprived section of our society. If these underprivileged children are not educated today, then they will be exploited as child labourers, beggars or resort to crime for their livelihood, thus proving to be a menace to society. The need is to educate these children and change their mindset and guide them towards a bright future. This positive change is being brought about through the medium of Aarambh Bal Bhavan in the colony of the Dombari community of the Kashti village. This colony houses about 450 families living in very poor conditions. This underdeveloped tribal community lives a nomadic life, performing their traditional art and moves around from village to village. The youth of the Kashti village are performing the Herculean task of changing the destiny of 480 children living in such dire conditions.
?	Freedom Fighter Ramanlal Mehta Library
Mahamanav Baba Amte Bahuddashiya Samajik Vikas Sewa Sanstha provides library service to needy students and other citizens of Taluka Shrigonda. The library also serves as a centre of study for various competitive exams viz. MPSC, UPSC, IPS etc. The youth of Taluka Shrigonda are inclined to applying for government jobs. The team of Mahamanav Baba Amte Sanstha started the Freedom Fighter Ramanlal Mehta Library to fulfill this need and help the youth to get good government jobs. The library has over 3500 books and is visited by 125 students yearly. Workshops are also conducted by experts to guide and prepare the youth for various competitive exams.
?	Bharat Ratna Dr. A.P.J Abdul Kalaam Study Center
There was a need in Shrigonda for a center with an environment conducive for knowledge gaining where students could come to study and prepare for various competitive exams as well as overall personality development. The Bharat Ratna Dr. A.P.J Abdul Kalaam Study Center was thus inaugurated at Shrigonda by Hon. Anna Hazare and Dr. Ravindra Kolhe on 26th Dec 2015 on the occasion of the birth anniversary of internationally renowned social activist Baba Amte. Currently 52 students visit the center every day to study.
B.	Awareness

Inspired by internationally renowned social activist Baba Amte, his wife Reverend Sadhnatai Amte, Tribune Annasaheb Hazare and the Snehalaya family, Mahamanav Baba Amte Bahuddashiya Samajik Vikas Sewa Sanstha organizes lecture series on the occasion of the death anniversary of Baba Amte and the birth anniversary of Saint Gadge Maharaj. Prominent speakers and leaders are invited to create awareness amongst the masses about various social issues. The NGO feels that the youth today needs to be guided by inspiring thoughts along with academics in order to broaden their horizons. Hence the lecture series! Thousands of youth from many rural areas are influenced by this initiative of the NGO towards a better future.

?	An active support in different movements for social development will be practiced.
?	A center for competitive exams for the youth especially belonging to nomadic tribes.
Over the years we have grown in terms of scale as well as scope while retaining our core values and high commitment level. However, we are aware that fulfilling our mission requires us to do lot more and we are getting ready to transform Mahamanav Baba Amte Sewa Sanstha from an organisation to an Institution that will outlive it’s founders and contribute to emerging Social Welfare challenges. We therefore seek support and guidance from a much broader network of partners for the journey ahead.
Mahamanav Baba Amte Sewa Sanstha has been instrumental in social welfare of the children of the tribal communities of Phasay Pardhi and Dombari since last 9 years and will continue this work tirelessly and include many more under privileged students.
The past beneficiaries of Mahamanav Baba Amte Sewa Sanstha have been deeply influenced by our philosophy. Our NGO's past students have continued their association and taken the responsibility of the weaker students.
Mahamanav Baba Amte Sewa Sanstha is seeking support for volunteers, technical guidance, sharing of ideas and financial assistance for its projects.
About our Founder
Shri Anant Zende founded Mahamanav Baba Amte Bahuuddeshiy Samajik Vikas Seva Sanstha as he was driven by an extraordinary dream that every child is entitled to good food, shelter, clothing and education. All through the early, difficult years, it was his passion and conviction that drove our NGO. He was strongly convinced that each of us can, in our own small way, be agents of change, and when enough of us are involved in this process, the impact is a long lasting change and that too for the better. All he asks of people is that they help our NGO by doing what they are good at.
With inspiration from leaders like Baba Amte, Sadhnatai Amte and Dr. Girish Kulkarni of Snehalaya, he started the first project of our NGO Vidhyarthi Sahhayak Samiti (Students Aid Council) at Shrigonda in Ahmednagar district was established on July 23rd, 2008. He works in a rural school during the day and devotes all his spare time to our NGO.",150,FY 2018-19,"Impact:-
1.	15 students of ShrigondaTaluka and extremely poor families are provided with the facility of residence-food-library and also training at the centre’sVidyarthi Sahayak Samiti project.
2.	130 children of ‘Phase paradhi’ community whose parents are either locked in jail or have expired; receive love, education and shelter at MBBVSS EklavyaPrakalpand saved their lives from getting distracted.
3.	80 children are the part of MBBVSSS Sadhana Balbhavanin the slums of Shrigonda and are shaping theirfuture here.
4.	MBBVSS Arambh Bal Niketan is working for the rehabilitation of 56 children belonging to the Dombari tribes who perform gymnastics and other exercises on streets and public places to earn a living.
Expected Impact:-
1)	The stream of new donors will increase due to the new premises of Swami Vivekananda Rashtriya Antyodaya Kendra. There will be a rise of up to 25% in the institutional contribution by the people who will visit the project. The number of beneficiaries which we can accommodate will increase. This will help us shape the future of more and more children from the tribal population.This will result in the increase of the helping hands as well as number of members of the MBBVSS.
2)	We can provide best facilities to the students taking shelter here.
3)	The number of volunteers and staff working here will also increase. We can also invite experts from various fields to guide our beneficiaries for carrier development.As there will be separate sections for children of various age groups, their mental & physical growth will be up to the mark. At present this growth cannot always be achieved.
4)	The professional competence & quality of work done here will also increase. This will result in a long term benefit for the organization.
5)	The nurturing of children with special needs will also be done properly.
6)	More donors and corporates for CSR activities can be invited.",https://www.givingtuesdayindia.org/civicrm/file/imagefile?id=1399&eid=21413&fcs=ed375ee412ebc178d6b656b144829ab9ac421aaa6ec7e4b5bb19b46c6f29ff14_1575213082_168#,http://www.babaamtevss.org,vssanant@gmail.com,91-9404976833,"Kulkarni Waada, Gavaligalli, Tal Shrigonda Dist Ahmednagar 413701,

We have always believed in the ability of an individual to make lasting positive change in society and MAYA enables individuals to collectively solve their concerns. We have been working to create an empowered and equitable society that systemically addresses livelihood, education and now health.
Past Projects/ Impact: The differentiating facet of MAYA‚Äôs working culture is that our past projects have evolved into successful independent entities impacting millions of lives.
‚Ä¢ Maya Organics (Social Enterprise(www.mayaorganic.com)
‚Ä¢ Prajayatna (NPO):(www.prajayatna.in)
‚Ä¢ Labournet (Social Enterprise):(www.labournet.in)
We have learnt much from our past work on education and livelihood where one of our key take away has been that health is a crucial parameter in an individual‚Äôs life, affecting the ability of such vulnerable sections of society to escape poverty. This is a burning systemic issue which gave rise to the MAYA Health Project.
About MAYAHealth
The whole premise of the MAYA Health Initiative is to drive preventive and promotive health practices in the rural and semi urban communities; by creating a new channel of dedicated, trained, technology enabled healthcare micro entrepreneurs who will act as the last mile connect between the healthcare ecosystem and the community in rural/semi-urban India.
MAYA Health Mission: ‚ÄúTo build a sustainable health ecosystem of caregivers who focus on providing preventive- promotional health care services and access to primary healthcare that is affordable to the community.‚Äù
We are empowering local women into health networks enabled with technology to promote health ownership and education. We call these women Health Navigators (HNs). They are inherently a network of caregivers who are delivering quality healthcare to the doorsteps of people. They are creating an environment where communities can make informed health decisions and have access to affordable quality primary healthcare.
Key Objectives:
1. Develop health knowledge of the individual and community to take control of their health, access health services and actively participate in building healthy environments.
2. To train and empower local Health Navigators to deliver high quality, affordable and easily accessible preventive healthcare services to the community. Thereby acting as a last mile connect to healthcare.
3. Develop a sustainable ecosystem and linkages to support Health Navigators and address health needs of the community.
4. Develop a model that can be sustainably scaled up using technology and create an impact on health in India.
Why is this important: We strongly believe that ‚ÄúWithout health there is no escape from poverty!‚Äù, and with our project we envision to support communities to move from a reactive mind-set to that of a proactive one towards health. This makes it possible for individual ownership of health becoming a reality. We are empowering women and mobilizing partnerships with organizations that can further support this initiative in order to reach 3 million people in the next 5 years. Each Health Navigator trained is a golden resource as a healthcare provider in her community and reaches out to over 2000 people. She acts as a last mile connect and provides linkages to critical health ecosystems in her community.
Hence long term engagements on developing the model and scaling up the project could accelerate impact to larger groups of marginalized communities.",,,"1. Successfully have on board 30 Health Navigators as a part of our pilot completion stage.
2.Have over 3800 people directly impacted through services of health Navigators

Through these activities the children are able to express themselves in order to understand the meaning of ‘ ‘childhood’ and that every child has a right to be a child and that every child has the right to ask for their rights responsibily. 
This is especially true of underpreviledged children. In the long run it helps bring out their apptitude . understanding of the need for child rights and therefore empowers them to find ways of moving forward given the environment they live in and the lack of amenities they have no access to. It also helps teach them to stand up to abuse and isolation. 
The trust is named after Mitsuko – a friend who was a regular visitor to India and who was moved by the vicissitudes of life in India especially that of children. After her death her husband Daniel wanted to respect her wishes which led to the birth of Mitsuko Trust or “Child of Light” which in Japanese is the meaning of her name.",,,,,,mitsukotrust@yahoo.co.in,91-9326128065,"Rebelo bldg, 1 St Flr, opp Cafe Bhonsale,,

Vocational Skill Development:- High rate of growth of urban population and consequent increase in population residing in slums has today lead to over-straining of infrastructure and deterioration in a chance for employment and wide inequalities in accessing services. Such hostile circumstances coupled with the lack of social network and fall back options, arguably leads the inhabitant population to the ‚Äúsevere poverty trap‚Äù.

This further contributes to gender equality where women equally stands by her family just as a male member and becomes much more confident and motivated.

The issue of gender equality crosscuts all of our work.
As an organisation built on the experience of civil society interventions in India and inheriting the best practices from the International Development Agency, Christian Aid, and the Poorest Areas Civil Society (PACS) programme (one of the largest civil society programme of DFID implemented by Christian Aid led CSO consortium), Phia is able to draw on excellent experience of scale, addressing complex issues of poverty with depth of interventions.

Phia Foundation primarily follows a rights-based approach for inclusive, sustainable development. When appropriate we support service-based interventions. Evidence based advocacy to improve policy implementation is integral to our approach. We also directly implement programmes and work through a partnership model with local grassroots organisations, building their capacity and leadership to help ensure a lasting impact on poverty and social exclusion. We collaborate with others, as we believe brining hearts, mind, capabilities and resources for solutions to address the complex issues of poverty.

We help provide them with practical support as well as giving extra education to help them return to formal education to give them a route out of poverty and a chance to fulfil their potential in life.
We have also responded to a number of emergencies in India, including the flooding in Orissa and the flooding in Jammu and Kashmir.Our work here helped to support the lives of over 15,000 people.As in all of our work we focus on those who are most in need and who are often left out of relief operations or are discriminated against.We help to provide life-saving support such as clean water to ensure that people survive when an emergency strikes and we remain to support communities in the long-term to help them back on to their feet.",,http://www.phia.org.in,info@phia.org.in,,"D25/D, S.J.House, South Extension Part II,

The modest beginnings in 2001 soon grew in both scope and outreach and we are proud to be where we are at the end of a decade, having impacted approximately 5600+ children and over 200 elderly. 
We began with the establishment of a balwadi, a daycare centre for children of construction workers and laborers at Hadapsar and slowly expanded our outreach to several groups across Pune, Mumbai and Lonavla. 
Beginning 2007, our designated year for Child Education, Development and Empowerment (CEDE) and seeing the consequent need for sustained intervention; we decided to concentrate our efforts towards education of underprivileged children. 
With a vision to spawn a wave of transformation, having received an overwhelming response to our first Development Centre (DC) and its subsequent success inspired us to broaden our approach and outreach to formulate a whole new module that would target younger children.

This is the way they breakout of the poverty to which their families are condemned. We focus on girls and since we understand that without complete nutrition and comprehensive medical care there can be no accomplishment, we provide all these as well for free.
Post School assistance is also provided to help all students‚Äô progress into higher learning. Students who pass out after completing class 12th, receive support through our ‚ÄòOn to Life‚Äô program. All eligible children receive Counselling and guidance to help them progress into Institutes of higher learning, skill oriented professions or enterprise. Many of these wards also receive financial support for post School learning in Universities through initiatives of the Society and financial support to secure admission into good colleges/professional courses/ other programs.
At School the focus is on education and a positive attitude to life.Skills of empathy and the instinct to share are taught at School and this helps them cope with adversity, pursue proper conduct and makes them good leaders Children realize that there is an honest way to live, work and prosper; that a moral life can help practice values of a human and help them rise above the compulsions of animal instincts.
Children attend School 6 days a week, 10 hours a day and 270 days a year. A competent faculty, that has a regular schedule of in-house-training/workshops, impart quality education. There are no drop outs over the several years of care and classically children are cared for about 14 years. Absenteeism from School is rare. The intention is to care for them over these many years and finally launch them into life.
Till date 151 students have passed out from our School. We also support some of these children post 12th. Some of these children are currently in companies such as Infosys, IBM etc. Three of my children are also pursuing further education from the United States of America. All these children are sons and daughters of watchmen, gardener, electrician, laborer etc.
Since the negative conditions in their homes (Small spaces occupied by a large family, dark and dingy) prevent them from covering the last mile for outstanding scores, the Society has recently made possible a comfortable and well equipped hostel facility for about 90 girls and 40 boys.

This obviously is not safe for patient care.As patients if you don‚Äôt know enough about sources, you are at the risk oftrusting information that may not be authentic.

4.This year SATHI worked in 28 Govt. Homes (14 Govt. Girls‚ÄövÑv?‚àövë‚àö¬• Homes, 13 Govt. Boys‚ÄövÑv?‚àövë‚àö¬• Homes and one Children‚ÄövÑv?‚àövë‚àö¬•s Home), with 6 Govt. Homes being SATHI‚ÄövÑv?‚àövë‚àö¬•S first time intervention.In these Govt. Homes, 1798 children were counselled and addresses of 55% of children were traced. Addresses of 20% children could not be traced and tracing addresses of 25% of children is under way. 
5.During this year, 7 camps were organised in 4 states. 176 children rescued from platforms and those staying for more than 3 months at Govt. Homes participated in these camps. Among the children selected at camps this year, 60% of children were repeated runaways while 40% were addicted to substance. SATHI was successful in tracing addresses of 81% children involved in camps. Of those whose addresses were traced, 93% of children were reunited with their parents or families. The remaining 7% are still staying at Govt. Homes. 
6.Along with regular outreach work, we conduct intense operations called as ‚ÄövÑv?‚àövë‚àö‚â§Rescue Drive-Early Intervention‚ÄövÑv?‚àövë‚àö¬•. These operations are conducted at project and non-project locations of Sathi.10-12 staffs and volunteers work in shifts of 12-14 hours thus, increasing the possibility of rescuing more number of children within a given day. 926 children were rescued from 40 rescue drives (31 in project locations and 9 in non-project locations) in this year. 
7.149 Family Reunion programs have been organised across locations in the year 2016. Dignitaries from Department of Women and Child, CWC members, police officials, organizations, academicians, railway authorities and individuals working with children are invited to these functions. These are emotional events. It is extremely fulfilling to see children finally leaving for their homes with their parents. Shri Suresh Prabhu, the Honourable Minister for Railways and Shri. Manish Sisodia, Deputy Chief Minister of Delhi witnessed such programs during this year. 
8.SATHI has been engaging with officials in the MWCD on a wide range of issues.

We receive their constant support like in daily dairy entries of rescued children, in counselling, address tracing of parents. Other than Govt. authorities, vendors, coolies and general public also help us at the platform.
10.Yoga classes, Drawing sessions, Story-telling sessions, Extra-curricular activities, outdoor games are conducted for children at Sathi shelters. This year, computers have been installed across locations for engaging children. Festivals like Independence Day, Holi, Diwali etc. & Birthdays of children are celebrated at Sathi shelters. 
11.ISKCON donated free lunch for children at Yeshwantpur, Bangalore and New Delhi, Sai Temple in Delhi provided free food for once in a week. NGO GOONJ at New Delhi provided food material, games material, clothes and musical instrument. At other locations, many individual donors donated money, kitchen items, food, games material, clothes, blankets, bed sheets. 
12.Ms.Gangandeep Kaur, Clinical Psychologist from Unique psychological solutions, New Delhi, helped us in developing a manual on ‚ÄövÑv?‚àövë‚àö‚â§Various Practices of Engaging with the Child in 2016-17‚ÄövÑv?‚àövë‚àö¬• was developed. 
13.SATHI conducts follow ups of children for a year after their restoration. It helps in understanding the pace of their reintegration. Follow ups are of two kinds, namely, telephonic follow ups and physical visits to the homes of restored children. Telephonic follow ups are done for every child. The first call is made one month after restoration. The second and third call follows after 3 months and 6 months of the first call, respectively. This year telephonic calls were made to 6000 children restored from shelter, camps and Govt. Homes.SATHI was able to contact 67% of children and the remaining 33% could not be contacted. 
14.Physical follow ups of around 380 children across 6 locations in Berhampur, Kanpur, Kolkata, Mughalsarai, Patna and Visakhapatnam was done. During physical follow ups, SATHI learnt that 2% of the restored children have migrated to other places.SATHI is happy to know that 96% of the remaining children continue to stay or be in touch with their families. Of these, 97% stay at home while 3% stay away but are very much in touch with their families.Among those in touch with families, 59% of children are now staying at home studying and 25% are working either nearby or away from home. 16% are idle at home.
15.A study on status of children reunited with their families in 2005-06 was conducted in 2016-17, 10 years since their home repatriation. The purpose was to know how responsible the children had become towards themselves, their family and society. We intended to understand the long term impact of ‚ÄövÑv?‚àövë‚àö‚â§rescuing children from platforms‚ÄövÑv?‚àövë‚àö¬• and ‚ÄövÑv?‚àövë‚àö‚â§reuniting them with their families‚ÄövÑv?‚àövë‚àö¬•. We took 144 cases all from Bangalore and Wadi in Karnataka, and Tirupati in Andhra Pradesh.120 addresses could be located. 15 families had moved out and were not traceable. In the end, we could meet 105 families. Among these 105, 2 children had run away, and unfortunately another 6 are no more.Thus, we could meet 95 children.One of the 95 is physically challenged and is not working. Another is in jail for a crime. It was satisfying to see the children fulfill their responsibilities.
16.Identification of Vulnerable and Needy children in Villages of India ‚ÄövÑv?‚àövë‚àö¬® Integrated Child Protection Scheme ensures to provide preventive, statutory, care and rehabilitation services to vulnerable children including children from potentially vulnerable families and families at risk. This year SATHI conducted a survey on identifying needy and vulnerable children in villages of Varanasi and Visakhapatnam. This survey was to find out the number of such children, the kind of help they require and most importantly in linking these children to ICPS scheme. One district each from Varanasi and Visakhapatnam were included in the study. 9 staff and 10 volunteers surveyed 123 villages in 13 days.176 children from 73 villages of Varanasi and 172 children from 50 villages of Visakhapatnam were identified as needy and vulnerable.This is a unique survey of voluntarily screening villages in identifying vulnerable and needy children. The number of children in need in just few villages tells us about the many more needy children in villages of different states across India. A consolidated report of both the studies has been submitted to respective DCPU, CWCs and DWCD.
17.In 2016-17, ‚ÄövÑv?‚àövë‚àö‚â§Goonjan android app‚ÄövÑv?‚àövë‚àö¬• has been developed to enable real-time feeding of profile of children at the railway platforms.SATHI‚ÄövÑv?‚àövë‚àö¬•s data management systems have evolved and become robust over a period of time, with the level of data captured per child being exhaustive. This year, we proposed that the system can be adopted and used by multiple organizations working in the same field. Towards this, SATHI has demonstrated the entire process and its benefits to different organizations including funding agencies and consulting organizations including Azim Premji Philanthropic Initiatives, Dalberg, Mumbai and IFMR (Institute of Financial management & Resource, Chennai). We are also exploring if the process and model can be adopted or integrated with Childline‚ÄövÑv?‚àövë‚àö¬•s data capture process, especially in locations where Railway Childline has been started. 
18.SATHI has started entering details of found children in the KhoyaPaya portal provided by the Ministry of Women and Child Development, Govt. of India. In 2016-2017, 1245 entries were made by SATHI on the portal.",,http://www.sathi-india.org,bshali.sathi@gmail.com,91-8095037071,"# 73, 1st Floor,""Kamadhenu"",

Ushaben and Gulabbhai Jani were Professors of Economics in a college affiliated to Saurashtra University in 1967. As part of the celebrations of the birth centenary of Sister Nivedita, they arranged few lectures and programs in the college. Swami Atmasthanandji, the then President of Ramkrishna Ashram, Rajkot was quite impressed by their work. Swami Atmasthanandji asked them to carry out the same activities at the school level as well. Inspired by him, Smt. Ushaben and Shree. Gulabbhai opened a small K.G. school in the name of Sister Nivedita in 1968 and thus Sister Nivedita Educational Complex (SNEC) came into existence.
The aim of SNEC is to provide quality education to all. We aim to challenge the conventional ""teacher-to-student"" or one-way method of teaching, giving way to active involvement of the students in the learning process through group workshops, activities and interactive sessions. Our effort is directed to encourage self-learning, while developing the mind, body and spirit.
After one year of activities of Sister Nivedita Educational Complex, parents and guardians of the students approached and persuaded us to start primary school and a year later to start High School and Higher Secondary School.

We are an India based charity with our footprint in 8 Indian states and having served over 15,000 beneficiaries through our work.
At present, we work on promotion of Climate Smart Crops and Agriculture, directly with the farmers and also by facilitating market linkages. We primarily do this work in Anantapur district in Andhra Pradesh, which is the second most drought-prone region in the country. The main thrust of our work is encouraging more farmers to move to grow millets, which are climate-smart and nutrition-smart crops. They take very less water to grow, thrive in poor, saline soils and ensure a safe and reliable harvest for farmers despite poor rainfall. Apart from this we also link them to markets for their produce.
We would further like to expand this work and support farmers through a more structured intervention focusing on technical know-how, organic certifications, processing, value addition and awareness generation on the health benefits of these foods. This has the potential to provide further livelihood options in an area which suffers from a multitude of problems including limited livelihood options, due to adverse climatic conditions.
An intervention designed to promote and revive these crops in the rural areas would also fit extremely well with the vision of the United Nations‚Äô Sustainable Development Goals, specifically, SDG 2: End Hunger, Achieve Food Security and Improved Nutrition and Promote Sustainable Agriculture, and SDG 13 Climate Action
We are very enthusiastic about this project and feel that it has the potential to have a lasting impact, not just on the lives of the farmers but also the environment.
On the other end of the spectrum, we are also working with women in urban slums to provide them with an alternative to make their own nutrition packed diet. Special focus on pregnant and lactating women groups to produce healthy and safe food for their needs.",,,"1. Training of 25 families each from Delhi and Noida on Nutrition and Healthy cooking

UTMT targets rural poverty in underdeveloped, tribal districts of Maharashtra, Gujarat and M.P. through Bees for Poverty Reduction strategy. This unique and innovative framework impacts small farmers through livelihood diversification with increased agricultural productivity due to low cost beekeeping. This increases employment and incomes for small and marginal farmers.
Declining agricultural growth rates over the last two decades, in addition to a slower employment growth rate, necessitate an urgent need to diversify rural livelihoods and improve incomes of the rural poor. Given that the benefit of beekeeping is 40 times more than the value of honey and beeswax, the first National Commission on Agriculture (1976) in India had recommended beekeeping purely as an agricultural input and put forth a plan for apiculture until 2000. However, subsequent agricultural policy unfortunately did not give beekeeping the importance it deserves.
Our Bees for Poverty Reduction (BPR) Programme concentrates on:
‚Ä¢ Increase in agricultural yields of small and marginal farmers by 40-50% through Bee-pollination.
‚Ä¢ Training at the village level over a 12 month period of hand holding and support so that the training incorporates local flora, seasonal management which is crucial for successful beekeeping.
‚Ä¢ Creating a cadre of local Master Trainers who will facilitate scaling up the model locally.
‚Ä¢ Creating long term, sustainable market linkages for the farmer for the honey and beeswax produced.
Achievements:
‚Ä¢ Since 2009, 2500 farmers have benefited from BPR, primarily through increased agricultural yields.
‚Ä¢ A 2011 rapid impact survey conducted by UTMT in Gujarat found that A. Cerana beekeepers experienced 30% to 160% higher agricultural yields (depending on crop) compared to similar farmers without bee-boxes.
‚Ä¢ A small-scale study conducted by Dalberg Associates found that BPR beekeepers increased annual household savings, invested in assets, and spent more on health and education after training.
‚Ä¢ UTMT was among the top three emerging innovations in the Agriculture and Rural Innovations Category at the 2009 Sankalp awards, an all India competition organised by Intellecap and Rockefeller Foundation that recognises innovative work.
‚Ä¢ The following year, UTMT was highlighted as one of ‚Äú25 Good Businesses‚Äù in the Outlook Business Independence Day Special Issue.
‚Ä¢ In 2011 UTMT was recognised as one of the top five ‚ÄúSocial Innovations‚Äù in the CNBC TV 18 Samsung Innovation Quotient.
‚Ä¢ The BPR model was featured as a low cost external input for sustainable agriculture in the well known LEISA magazine‚Äôs March 2012 issue. The LEISA article highlighted UTMT‚Äôs research findings which demonstrated the critical link between bees and agricultural productivity.
‚Ä¢ UTMT‚Äôs work has also been profiled in several widely read Indian publications, including Economic Times, Indian Express, Hindustan Times and Express India.

How could a few individuals with only some dreams and desire bring a change? But, if the dreams are powerful and desires are strong, the rest comes by. Its founder Jaimala  (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sZApxZ_4CA) decided to give shape of her dreams of changing lives of a few street children and other disadvantaged children by registering the organization namely Vatsalya under Society Registration Act 1958 of Rajasthan in 1995. Here the idea was conceived by her of an abode, exclusively for these kids where they could feel belonged, cared and wanted. As the name indicates, the whole concept of the organization revolves around it. Vatsalya is a Sanskrit word meaning, a motherly tender and caring love for child and she believes that it exists everywhere.  She has transformed thousands of lives by her dedicated effort and leading the team of Vatsalya upfront. Vatsalya has become great place of local action by global community and nicely balanced with protecting children by nature friendly interventions. The school had 129 children in the 2015-16 and enrolment of 176 children was done in 2016-17 sessions, but 127 could continue in this year.  Since vocational training of 14+ children is an integral part of our education, we also need to have a trainer per 20 children which is a major challenge for us as it significantly increases the per child cost. Our skilled training and economic empowerment program for women has impacted lives of 446 women directly. Total youth trained under various skilled training program since 2009 is 6569 till March 2016. Currently we are training women in Kantha, stiching, tailoring, block printing and organic farming. The solar technician training is Vatsalya flagship skilled training program to create echo system in the environment sector. The Vatsalya has seen almost five hundred thousand patients free of cost from its clinic and health camps. Our organization has identified and linked more than 60 HIV/AIDS patients so far with government.Not for profit sector organisations are registered as the charitable organisation in India. Typically known as NGO or NPO, and comes under unorganised sector. But now government of India through act has covered these organisations under EPFO since April 2015.

‚Ä¢ Poverty
‚Ä¢ Unavailability fo schools
‚Ä¢ Inaccessibility to schools
‚Ä¢ Lack of quality education
‚Ä¢ Lack of a supportive family environment
As a first step, AIM for Seva launched Chatralayams (flagship project) to end the school drop out crisis and to bring schools and quality education right to the children‚Äôs doorstep. Chatralayams are residential facilitiesthat provide uninterrupted access to education in a nurturing environment. Accomodation, nutritious food, clothing, after-school academic support, extracurricular activities, value education are provided to all children at no cost. In simple terms children are given the opportunity to go to school and are encouraged to stay on in school, pursue higher education and find employment.The first Chatralayam was launched in Anaikatti, Tamil Nadu in 2001. Today, we have 97 Chatralayams across 16 states in India, from Kanyakumari to Karnaprayag. 
A deeper understanding of rural problems also revealed that education cannot be viewed in isolation and must complement interventions that address issues of poverty and healthcare. Subsequent interventions were designed to establish better health infrastructure, improve access to healthcare services and empower villagers through vocational training programs and sustainable livelihood models. 
In the last decade since its inception, AIM for Seva has delivered steady and spectacular growth:129 projects in 216 months or nearly a project for every two months of the year and from 1 state of operation to 16 states, all through donations. The impact is far reaching: 2267 villages and 20 million people, touched by this novel experiment in innovative education. In qualitative terms, school drop-out rate reduced by 90%, a 95% pass rate in the board examinations and many school toppers, since the first batch of students appeared for their board exams and 80% undertook higher education or secured employment. The success stories of our alumni stands as a testimony.
The vision for the future is clear: by 2020, to set up one Chatralayam in every district of the country. A challenging goal, but one that has to be realized so that every socially and educationally disadvantaged child can realize their dream of a prosperous future.",196093,FY 2017-18,"1. 97 Chatralayams (Free Student Hostels), catering to 3800 children across 16 states of India.
2. Reduced dropout rate by 90%

In the 1980‚Äôs autism was virtually unheard of in India, a diagnosis of autism was rare, and there was little information available. The majority of children with autism received a diagnosis of mental retardation, ‚Äòmental subnormality‚Äô or any number of other labels. Neither parents nor schools understood that these children were in fact autistic, and that children with autism respond best to specific intervention techniques. Schools and parents alike were helpless to provide adequate services to their children with autism.
In 1991, AFA began as a parent support group, with a focus on raising awareness about autism in India through smaller-scale project. In 1994 AFA began providing counselling services, specialised education and training for parents and professionals. March 1994 saw the start of ‚ÄòOpen Door,‚Äô the first specialised school for children with autism in South Asia. With the overwhelming response to these initiatives, the decision was taken to formally register Action for Autism in 1994.

Since 2006, Make A Difference reaches out to over 3,460 children in 67 shelters across 23 cities in India, through a highly efficient 3,822 strong volunteer network. Volunteers commit a year and spend between 2 to 10 hours every week mentoring, teaching and interacting with children in order to ensure that they get the support and care they need during childhood.
Through our core programmes, Ed Support, Foundational Programme, Dream Camps, Transition Readiness & Aftercare, Make a Difference creates a support system and an emotional safe space for children in shelters by ensuring every child has at least 3 adults who care for them, understand them and who they can reach out to when they feel overwhelmed. Children have access to trained mentors for a minimum of 2 hours a week from the age of 10 to 18, with a lighter touch approach upto 28 once they leave the shelter home. The programmes include career awareness activities, helping them identify their career path and supporting their transition to further education with both placements support and funding when required depending on their age and need. The Organisation also works closely with the shelter they are living in to ensure their basic needs are taken care of, interact with their teachers to understand their developmental needs, and engage with their guardians to build support for their choices and progression post-shelter. By the time the child comes out of the shelter home they already have strong relationships and bonds with at least 10 mentors who become their community when they need them the most.",48563,FY 2016-17,"The Organisation has mobilised 21,500 young leaders to volunteer with children since 2006.
