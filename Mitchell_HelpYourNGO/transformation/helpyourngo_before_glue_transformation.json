It works in partnership with other organisations in the development sector to make the best use of government policies and schemes.  PRASARI works in two opposite agro-climatic zones of West Bengal. One district is located at the hilly Jalpaiguri (Himalayan Dooars) and the other is at the delta in the Sundarbans (near Bay of Bengal). Both receive adequate rainfall but still suffer from water scarcity, either due to impermeable land or intrusion of salinity.

","267":"  Pratham Books' dream is to see an India where every child wants to read, is able to read, and has something good to read  They have published over 300 titles in 18 Indian languages so far  A majority of their books cost less than Rs50 and can be found in the remotest corners of the country  Pratham Books is a not-for-profit organization with the mission of putting a book in every child's hand. Their dream is to see a country where every child wants to read, is able to read, and has something good to read.  A large number of Indian NGOs are engaged in increasing child literacy. Research reveals that one in three school-going children cannot read fluently. Children who are unable to read are unable to learn, as they can't understand what is being taught to them. This contributes to high dropout rates in schools. Pratham Books supports child literacy by publishing and distributing affordable books to children who have limited reading resources.  In the last decade, Pratham Books has published over 300 titles in English and 18 major Indian languages. The NGO has printed story-cards to jump start a love for reading. A majority of the 2,000 books\u00a0published to date are priced below Rs50. With the aim to reach 200 million Indian children, Pratham Books continues to build alliances with leading publishing houses (like Orient Longman) to achieve this goal.  Story Weaver is a platform that hosts stories in languages from all across India, so that every child can have an endless stream of stories in her mother tongue to read and enjoy. All the stories are available under Creative Commons licenses which means that the stories are free to read, and can be translated into new languages, new stories can be created, and artworks can be freely accessed, by anyone.  Donate-a-Book is a unique crowd funding initiative by Pratham Books to help bridge the gap between those who want to help children read, and those who need books for children. The idea is to build a Reading India together by making storybooks accessible to thousands of children and spread the joy of reading. Around 42,000 books have been pledged so far under the Donate-a-Book initiative.\u00a0 ","268":"Praja Foundation is a non-partisan organisation working towards establishing accountability and transparency in governance by empowering citizens and providing them with knowledge and perspective.
